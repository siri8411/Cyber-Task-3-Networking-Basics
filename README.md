# Cyber-Task-3-Networking-Basics
TCP uses a three-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) to establish reliable connections. DNS resolves domain names into IP addresses. Packet sniffing allows security analysts to monitor traffic. HTTPS encrypts data, making it more secure than HTTP.
# Task 3 – Networking Basics for Cyber Security

## Concepts Covered
- IP and MAC addresses
- TCP vs UDP
- DNS
- TCP three-way handshake
- Packet sniffing
- HTTP vs HTTPS

## Outcome
